CODE SAMPLES  

Codewars KATA Array.diff

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result. It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.  

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]  

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other.   
Solution:   
javascript
function array_diff(a, b) {
  return a.filter(e => !b.includes(e));
}

Typescript code of header block:  

<div class="darkBlock"></div>
<header class="header">
  <img class="logo" src="../../assets/logo/logo_header.png" alt="Логотип">
  <app-search-bar></app-search-bar>
  <app-user-info-bar class="userButtons"></app-user-info-bar>
</header>
   
SCSS code for header:   

.darkBlock{
    background-color: #005698;
    height: 15px;
    width: 100%;
    box-shadow: 0px 1px 18px black;
}
header {
    background-color: #0082C9;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    box-shadow: 0px 1px 18px #888888;

    @media all and (max-width: 510px){
        height: 132px;
    }

    .logo{
        height: 75px;
        margin-top: 15px;

        @media all and (max-width: 823px){
            display: none;
        }
    }

    .userButtons{
        margin-top: 35px;    
        width: 127px;

        @media all and (max-width: 823px){
            display: none;
        }
    }
}
 

WORK EXPERIENCE
August 2016 - March 2020 | National Center Of Legal Information
Most of time I worked as a .Net + MSSQL developer on the interior projects of my organization. Than I was suggested to study at the IT Academy on basic front-end course and try to work as a junior front-end developer in angular project and in other project, that was based on Bootstrap. From that time I understood that want to develop in front-end or to be in future a full stack developer.

Unfortunately I can`t show my work prjects because they were made for internal use of NCLI. So, I leave link to my [RSSchool CV project](https://github.com/violetta30/rsschool-cv).
